            The painting shows a pipe. Below it, Magritte painted, 
            <q lang="fr">Ceci n'est pas une pipe.</q>, French for 
            "This is not a pipe."
        </p>
        <p>
            His statement is taken to mean that the painting itself is not a pipe. 
            The painting is merely an image of a pipe. Hence, the description, 
            "this is not a pipe."
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, the image shown above is neither a pipe nor even a painting, 
            but rather a digital photograph.
        </p>
        <p>
            The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message conveyed 
            by paralanguage. Compare with Korzybski's <q>The word is not the thing</q> 
            and <q>The map is not the territory</q>.

        My Bed, first created in <time property="dateCreated" datetime="1998">1998</time>,

            <cite>My Bed</cite> was exhibited at the Tate Gallery in 
            <time property="datePublished" datetime="1998">1999</time> as one 
            of the shortlisted works for the Turner Prize. It consisted of her 
            bed with bedroom objects in an abject state, and gained much media 
            attention. Although it did not win the prize, its notoriety has 
            persisted.

        The artwork generated considerable media furore, particularly over the 
        fact that the <span property="materials">bedsheets</span> were stained 
        with bodily secretions and the floor had items from the artist's room 
        (such as <span property="materials">condoms</span>, 
        <span property="materials">a pair of knickers</span> with menstrual 
        period stains, other detritus, and functional, everyday objects, 
        including a <span property="materials">pair of slippers</span>). The 
        <span property="materials">bed</span> was presented in the state that 
        Emin claimed it had been when she said she had not got up from it for 
        several days due to suicidal depression brought on by relationship 
        difficulties.

            <cite>Still Life under the Lamp</cite>, from 1962, made when the artist 
            was eighty years old, are counted among Picasso’s most important works 
            in linocut, a technique that he explored in the late 1950s and early 
            1960s. The progressive proofs show the step by step sequence by which 
            Picasso created his linocut images showing the development of the 
            image into its final form.
